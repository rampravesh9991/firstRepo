    <h1>Chemestry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemestry is a branch of sicence that deals with the properties, compositions and behaviour of matter it is a facinating field that 
        that explores the building blocks of the Universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
        The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as
        Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, O for Oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>Chemical equations</i>. Here is an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equations represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(h<sub>2</sub>)</i> and Oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i>
    to form <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in the chemical reaction. It involves balancing 
    chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atom of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup> represents charges
    or number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemestry plays crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of air we breathe to the reactions that
        power our bodies, chemestry influences every aspect of our lives.
